# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Overview

This project serves as a practical introduction to using Google Firestore, focusing on understanding and implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The project does not include a user interface for dynamic input and deletion of posts. This serves as a introduction to understanding CRUD and lays the foundation for using it dynamically in future projects.
